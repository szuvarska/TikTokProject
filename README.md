This shiny app visualizes our data from TikTok. On the left menu we can choose a user (Purple Monster, Orange Monster or Red Monster) and section (Activity, Sharing or Tiktoks). Then on the main panel we see a variety of plots presenting our data. The plots are interactive so don't hesitate to play with sliders or checkboxes.
